# Deploy to Azure

Follow this [link](https://github.com/smartninja/example-azure-flask) to create an Azure App Service and connect to this GitHub Repository.
Please Select "Python 3.7" when creating the Web App, because the requirements.txt generated by Poetry requires an old version of pip ([Bug](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/3472))


Update the `startup command` to `gunicorn --bind=0.0.0.0 --timeout 600 cross_device_share.app:app`

Add application settings (environment variables) called "USER" and "PASS", fill your selected user name and password.
# Setup Dev Environment

First clone this repo then change to the repo directory.

poetry install   # Create virtual environement, install all dependencies for the project
poetry shell     # activate the virtual environment

```
